This file is used to give all separate style files access
to variables, mixins, etc. Don't forget to require it in all
separate style files that need mixins/variables.

Beware not to include any styles that generate actual CSS - it
will be duplicated in compiled files as many times as you include
this one somewhere.

If you want to extend classes - declare extendable classes as
%class-to-extend
and not
.class-to-extend
this way thay will not be compiles into actual CSS. This is calles
