/**
svg-url-loader with limit=4096 is used to process SVG files.
This means that if you include SVG file in you styles, svg-url-loader
will load it and if it's size is less then 4096 bytes it will inline
it into CSS file, otherwise - put it it `${"config.buildDir"}/img`
directory.

svg-url-loader will inline a file every time it's used in styles, so if
you use the same file in different CSS classes it will be inlined for
each of those classes, increasing the size of compiled CSS file. Instead,
we use placeholer selectors here to require each SVG file once and than
use @extend %svg-ornament everywhere we need this background image
